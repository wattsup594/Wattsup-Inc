    <h2>Client Report</h2>
    <p>1. How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?<br> 
        I decided to use the images and content that I used, because I have wanted to create a vacation planning website since the first time I started Web Fundamentals. I wanted to make sure that the images and content that I used centered around the vacation planning theme that I had. <br><br>
        
        2. How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?<br> 
        I communicated with them through email and at least on my end there wasn't any problems with communication. <br><br>
        
        3. Did your developer meet your expecatations for your site?<br> 
        Yes I beleive that the developer did. There's a few modifications that I would make, but overall the developer planned the site like I wanted it to be planned. <br><br>
        
        4. What will you do differently next time  you hire a team to do a project for you?<br> 
        I would probably try and communicate more with the developer and I would also try and make a better wireframe. <br><br>

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
    <p>1. How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs?<br> 
        I communicated with them through email and in class to make sure they understood their assignements. <br><br>
        
        2. How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?<br> 
        I communicated with them through email and at least on my end, there wasn't any issues. <br><br>
        
        3. How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?<br> 
        I think I handled it pretty well. There wasn't any issues with publishing the site and I was able to share the link with the client through email. <br><br>
       
        4. How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?<br> 
        It was very fun for me, because it gave me the chance to learn how to publish websites and it also gave the chance to learn how to build repositories. <br><br>

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
    <p>1. How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?<br> 
     For one of them I communicated through Microsoft Teams. The other one I only got communication from him during class. The first one I didn't have any issues with communication, but the second one I did as I was only able to give and receive information for the project in class. <br><br>
       2. Did you know what was expected of you for each site?<br>
     For the first one I knew what was expected for the site, but I didn't receive all of the resources I needed to be able to complete my part of the site. For the second one I didn't know what was expected of me until the project timeline was almost done. I was able to receive all of the resources to complete the project, however. <br><br>
     
     3. Were you able to contribute to your sites?<br> 
     Yes I was able to. <br><br>
     
     4. Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding changes to the sites?<br> 
     No I did not. <br><br>

    <h2>General Experience And Reflections</h2>
    <p>1. What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?<br>
    The most challenging part was trying to figure out how to publish my portal page on GitHub. When I added the wdd-130 folder to GitHub, it wasn't recognizing my index.html file. However, I was able to figure it out by putting the index file into the root folder. <br><br>
    
    2. What did you enjoy most about this project?<br> 
    I loved being able to work on different projects and learning how to do new things that I can include in my future projects. <br><br>
    
    3. What would you do differently if you could do the project again?<br> 
    I would make sure that for each part of the project, each group I'm apart of has some sort of communication set up on day one. I would also start explaining what the final project is at the start of the semester instead of the end. <br><br>
    
    4. Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain. <br> 
    I do feel more confident, because I was able to work in an environment that's closer to working a real job. I also gained experience in using tools that are used in jobs.
